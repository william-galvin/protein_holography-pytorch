Notes:
- Remember to note the e3nn version of the data, the CG coefficients, and the models because different versions of e3nn use different CG coefficients (and possibly then also different real spherical harmonics? unsure about this though)

TODO:
1. Make setup script that downloads CG coefficients from e3nn and notes the e3nn version
2. Make

# protein_holography-pytorch

REPOSITORY IN PROGRESS

Notes:
- Remember to note the e3nn version of the data, the CG coefficients, and the models because different versions of e3nn use different CG coefficients

TODO:
1. Make setup script that downloads CG coefficients from e3nn and notes the e3nn version
2. Make it so that user can specify path where pyrosetta is instead of using static global variable
